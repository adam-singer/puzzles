gattaca-brute is the solution grabbed from

http://www.simmoril.com/files/gattaca.py

In no way is this solution my attempt at solving the problem. 
This is the work of the poster (simmoril).

This solution was too slow, so dynamic programming came to the rescue.

The approach in gattaca is the one obtained here:

Note that the binary search for p[i] is crucial for O(nlogn) performance
